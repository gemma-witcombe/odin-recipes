</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 jar mariana sauce</li>
        <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded and divided</li>
        <li>15 dry lasagna noodles, divided</li>
        <li>15-16 ounces whole-milk ricotta cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat the oven to 400&degF</strong> and arrange a rack in the middle of the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown the beef and onion</strong>, start by chopping the medium onion and heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a larger frying pan or cast iron skillet. Once the oil is shimmering in the pan, add the onion and 1 pound of ground beef, 1/2 tablespoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Break up the beef into small pieces as it begins cooking until the beef is cooked through and there are no more raw bits, or 6-8 minutes. Remove from the heat and let it cool for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the meat sauce.</strong> Open 1 jar of marinara sauce (3 cups) and spread a thin layer in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir the remaining sauce into the ground beef mixture.</li>
        <li><strong>Begin layering the lasagna.</strong> Shred 12 ounces of mozzarella cheese if needed. Place 5 lasagna sheets in the baking dish, breaking them if needed to create a single layer (it's OK if the sheets overlap slightly). Spread a good layer of the ricotta cheese over the noodles, then spread about 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce on the ricotta, then sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella.</li>
        <li><strong>Continute layering the lasagna.</strong> Arrange another layer of lasagna over the cheese, followed by 1 cup of the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce, and 1 cup of the mozzarella. Top with a final layer of lasagna and the remaining sauce, spreading the sauce thin so that is almost completely covers the lasagna. Reserve the remaining cup of mozzarella for the end of baking. Cover the dish tightly with aluminium foil.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake the lasagna for 1 hour</strong>, check to make sure the sheets of pasta are done by poking the lasanga with a knife; the should slide easily through all the layers. If it doesn't, cover and cook for 15 minutes more.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and finish baking.</strong> Uncover the lasange and sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of mozzarella and the bake uncovered until the mozzarella is melted and lightly browned, and the sauce is bubbling, 8-10 minutes more. </li>
        <li><strong>Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes</strong> before slicing so the sauce has time to set.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve the lasagna.</strong> Slice the lasagna into 3-inch squares and serve.</li>
